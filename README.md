# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Deep learning model and image processing function to detect traffic sign which helps the self-driving cars


We aim to address detection and recognition of traffic signs. To
achieve this goal, we had two approaches and only one of them worked with a very high accuracy. Our two approaches were using image processing and the other one was using deep learning methods and techniques. In the image processing phase, we used shape recognition method and contour filtering. The contour filtering was used in order to draw a contour line around the shapes in the picture. The shape recognition was used in order to detect the shapes by their vertices. We faced some limitations using image processing methods and techniques, as we werenâ€™t able to fully recognize the traffic sign. So we started working on the deep learning phase. In the deep learning phase, we used the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, where it had 43 different traffic sign classes in different positions. We did a split of data, in order to use 80% of the data in the training phase and 20% in the testing phase. After that, we normalized the data in order to have a normal distribution and to make the computation more efficient. We used the Convolutional Neural Network with 3 hidden layers and an output layer. The learning rate was 0.001 and the epochs were 20. The accuracy of our model is 99.1%.
